# The Sound Of Sorting

As the title suggest, this application lets you hear the sound made my different algorithms during sorting. It also lets you see the sorting in action ( Its basically a sorting visualiser-audioliser ).

The sound produced has frequency based on the difference of the values of the elements that are being compared.
